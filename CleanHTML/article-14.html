					Economists are predicting that the nation’s unemployment rate stayed the same last month, as the steady uptick in the job market encouraged more people to start looking for work again.

The Labor Department’s February unemployment report -- to be released Friday morning -- is expected to show a gain of 210,000 jobs and a monthly unemployment rate of 8.3 percent, as it was in January.
