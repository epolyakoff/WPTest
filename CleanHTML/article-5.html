					When Republican Scott Brown stunned the political world in 2010 by winning the U.S. Senate seat held for 46 years by Edward M. Kennedy, it was former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney who introduced Brown at the joyous victory party in Boston.

A few weeks later, still basking in the rock-star glow of that unexpected win, Brown returned the favor. He introduced Romney at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference as “one of the Republican Party’s bright lights” and “my very, very dear friend.”
