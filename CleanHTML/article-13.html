					Kansas forward Thomas Robinson should be college basketball’s national player of the year.

Biased? As a KU alum, sure I am. But there are good statistical arguments for Robinson. In eight games against ranked opponents this season – seven were top six teams at the time – Robinson averaged 19.8 points (shooting 56 percent from the field and 76 percent from the line) and 12.3 rebounds. 
The junior’s overall averages were 18 points a game and 11.9 rebounds; he’s had 22 double-doubles this season.
