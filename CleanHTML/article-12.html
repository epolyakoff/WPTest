					With the end of their season potentially 40 minutes away Thursday, Maryland put together the sort of disciplined, smart and selfless performance Coach Mark Turgeon has pleaded for since November to steamroll Wake Forest, 82-60, and advance to the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament.

Sophomore Terrell Stoglin, whose scoring has carried the Terrapins through their injury-plagued season, led the team with 25 points but also proved he can do more than toss up jump shots, grabbing seven rebounds and dishing out four assists.
