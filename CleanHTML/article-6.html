					SAN FRANCISCO —Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you probably know that Apple just made a fairly major announcement. A couple of announcements, actually. At an event in San Francisco, the company introduced new versions of two of its most important products: the iPad and the Apple TV.

The iPad has now become just the “new” iPad — gone is the numbering from the previous version. The Apple TV remains the Apple TV, however. Both products look basically identical to their predecessors. But at least in the case of the iPad, there are some pretty significant differences.
