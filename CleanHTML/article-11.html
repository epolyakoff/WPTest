					Whether youâ€™re searching for a home, preparing to sell or just nosy about your neighbors, real estate Web sites include so many new features that they can become addictive.

Instead of waiting for an agent to dole out listings on their time schedule, you can search anonymously at midnight, receive e-mail alerts about newly listed homes or open houses, see market and neighborhood reports, map recent home-sale prices, and use apps that display listing details and interior photos of nearby homes.
