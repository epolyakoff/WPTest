					Forget the Republican delegate counts. Romantics in Washington are mourning the Super Tuesday loss of Capitol Hill’s favorite lovebirds: Dennis and Elizabeth Kucinich.

The redistricted Ohio Democrat lost his primary race to Rep. Marcy Kaptur— which means that the colorful liberal and his gorgeous young wife will no longer walk hand-in-hand through the halls of Congress.

Kucinich has created a stir since he landed in D.C. back in 1997: Boyish, short, outspoken and funny. He ranged from serious (opposition to the Iraq war, running for president twice) to quirky (doing an impression of Donald Duck). He teamed up with Republican Ed Gillespie to win second place in a celebrity stand-up comedy contest with a “Crossfire”-style routine and ventriloquist dummies. “Like most politicians, I’ve wanted to run for president in the worst way,” said Kucinich. “Well, you did!” answered the dummy.
